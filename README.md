This is just a small script that runs on a device on its own and controls each rack's LED strip colors. Soon this script will be able to show colors on only certain servers and other colors on different servers. However we dont have these addressable strips yet so this is a small dumb check server status and if the health status is bad (E.G server down, Failing fan/Drive) set color to fade red until issue is resolved then back to green
